# Tectonic Cloud Infrastructure Definitions

This repository contains configuration files for Tectonicâ€™s cloud
infrastructure. At the moment, that infrastructure consists of a few simple
services running off of the domain `fullyjustified.net`.

The `azure` directory contains [Terraform] files
that define the Tectonic services that run on [Microsoft Azure].
